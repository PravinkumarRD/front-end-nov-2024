    <ul>
        <li>User jcranmer: 12 posts.
        <li>User hober: 5 posts.
        
        <li>User <bdi>إيان</bdi>: 3 posts.
</ul>
    <p>The username of the Arabic user would end up confusing the text (the bidirectional algorithm would put the colon and the number "3" next to the word "User" rather than next to the word "posts").</p>
