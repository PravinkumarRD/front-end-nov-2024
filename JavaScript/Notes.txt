What is JavaScript?
1) It's a dynamic language

In JavaScript, functions written using function keyword, has implicit binding with this keyword. Hence, the this keyword will get executed under the owner of the function

In ES6, Arrow functions does not have implicit binding with this keyword and hence they do get executed under the same context of an object where they are defined

Type Extension Methods

	Number
	String
	Array
	Object

S.O.L.I.D.


Object Oriented Programming - 

	1) Abstraction - Gather the essential characteristics of an object
	2) Encapsulation - Hiding the implementation details
			Class
				[Private, Protected, Public]
				#_fiend [Any thing declared with # is private. Anything without # is public]
			Different Types of class
				Abstract Class, Concrete Class, Final/Sealed Class, Static Class
		
	3) Inheritance [Reusability]
		Generalization-To-Specialization
		Relationship - Is-A/Has-A
		Types - Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchy, Hybrid 
		Association - Uses-A Relationship
	Association is a Uses-A relationship where a class uses another class to perform some operation. Once class provides services to another class
	For Example - Employee class and EmployeeRepository class

		insertEmployee(Employee obj)

Composition - Has-A Relationship
	One class HAS-A reference to another class as an instance property. In this, child class cannot exist without parent class. Deleting parent class also deletes the child class.
	For Example - Employee HAS-An Address [Address class can not exist if Employee class is not there]

Aggregation - Another category of HAS-A Relationship
	One class HAS-A reference to another class as an instance property. However, both classes can exist independently.
	For Example - Employee HAS-A Department [Here, department can exist independently]


	4) Polymorphism
		Overloading/Compile time/Early Binding/ Static
		Overriding/Runtime/Late Binding/Dynamic

How do you use class?
1) Create an new instance
	class Customer{
		private num1;
		public num2;
		protected num3;
	}
	
	Customer c1=new Customer();

	c1.num2
	c1.num3
	
2) Extending the class
	class PrimeCustomer extends Customer{
		super.num2, num3
	}

SOA - Service Oriented Architecture [Web Services]

interface IHomeLoan{
	homeLoad();
}

class BajajServices implements IHomeLoan{
	homeLoad(){
		.....
	}
	carLoan(){...}
	personalLoan(){...}
}



BajajService pu=new BajajService();
pu.
IHomeLoan ar=new BajajService();
ar.personalLoad()
ka=new BajajService();

//Initialization
class Parent{
	constructor(){
		//Parent
	}
}

class Child extends Parent{
	constructor(){
		//Child
	}
}

class GrandChild extends Child{
	constructor(){
		//GrandChild
	}
}

new Grandchild();

Purchase Order System

	Customer, Employee, Supplier, Shipper, Category, Product, Order, OrderDetails, Invoice

Template Classes/Generics

ICommonRepository<T>{
	getAll():T[];
	getDetails(id:number):T;
	insert(item:T):void;
	update(id:number,item:T):void;
	delete((id:number):void;
}


class CommonRepository<T> implements ICommonRepository<T>{
	getAll():T[]{

	}
	getDetails(id:number):T;
	insert(item:T):void;
	update(id:number,item:T):void;
	delete((id:number):void;

}
ICommonRepository<Customer> customerRepo=new CommonRepository<Customer>();

customerRepo.getAll()


ICommonRepository<Employee> employeeRepo=new CommonRepository<Employee>();

employeeRepo.getAll()


ECMAScript Module - 

	Uses import and export keywords
		Why Modules?
			1) Modules have their own scope and they do not pollute the global scope
			2) Modules are loaded exactly once
			3) Modules can be loaded in a eager or lazy way
			4) Reusability

		1) Module Resolution
		2) Module Loading
		3) Module Execution


JavaScript Bundling System

	1) Webpack
	2) Rollup
	...
	
Export in ESM - There are two types
	1) Default Export
		You can have only one default export per module and benefit of using the default export is interoperability with other module systems
		While importing default exported value, you do not use {} brackets
		
	2) Named Export
		You can have as many named exports as you want in a module
		All named exports you can access in { } brackets while importing the module

	Example - import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
		React is default export and useState, useEffect are named exports
