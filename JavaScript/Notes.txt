What is JavaScript?
1) It's a dynamic language

In JavaScript, functions written using function keyword, has implicit binding with this keyword. Hence, the this keyword will get executed under the owner of the function

In ES6, Arrow functions does not have implicit binding with this keyword and hence they do get executed under the same context of an object where they are defined
